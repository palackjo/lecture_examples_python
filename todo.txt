- unhashable elements in sets
- + operator for sets (union) (- working properly) (solution: x | y)
- * operator for sets (intersection) (solution: x & y)
- {1 .. 10} workaround would be range(1, 11)
- {1, 3 .. 10} (=> {1, 3, 5, 7, 9})
- >< cartesian product ugly workaround on stack overflow
- **2 cartesian product with itself. Same story here
- 2 ** x power set. Same here aswell
- % symmetric difference (solution: x ^ y)


- is_prime(n) missing in Python (Fix in legendre.py)
- parse(string) check davis-putnam.stlx for reference

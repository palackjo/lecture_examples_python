# setl_to_python
Translating SetlX programs to Python

The intention of this project is to tranlate SetlX programs of Prof. Dr. Karl Stroetmanns lecture notes into Python.
Most problems could be solved way faster in Python but the main goal is to maintain the elegance of the algorithms.
The following directories contain the actual translation of SetlX programs to Python scripts.

## Aussagenlogik
### watson.py
The script watson.py doesn't work yet. The used syntax for matches in Python is just an idea what they could look like. Matches are currently being implemented.

## Other directories
The directories above contain the results of the translation. 
The other directories contain the modules that have/had to be implemented to imitate certain behaviors of SetlX.

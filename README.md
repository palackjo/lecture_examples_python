# setl_to_python
Translating SetlX programs to Python

The intention of this project is to tranlate SetlX programs of Prof. Dr. Karl Stroetmanns lecture notes into Python.
The main goal is to maintain the elegance of the algorithms.
The directory Python contains the actual translation of SetlX programs to Python scripts.

*Please note that the structure of this project has been modified. All Python scripts are now in the Python directory.*
This modification has been made to manage the version of the lecture directory more easily.

## lecture
Lecture represents the python package containing helper functions and classes, to manage and support special setlX features that are not given in python
